About the Application:
The project aims to provide travel information of Japan for foreign tourists visiting Japan for the first time. This includes the following modules.
+ Searching for different places.
+ Shows 5-day weather forecast from the current day. (using openweathermap API)
+ Shows more details about the weather information for a specific day.
+ Shows list of most visited nearby points of interest of the specified city. (using foursquare API)
+ Shows a map of all the nearby POI of the specified city. (using googlemap) 

About the UI/UX:

Upon landing on the page the site lets the user grasp immediate information needed. The developer also made sure that the site will not be crowded by less important information by creating a "More" feature where a pop up comes out to show the detailed information of the weather forecast for a specific date. It is also worth mentioning that the site is responsive enough to cater any device.
